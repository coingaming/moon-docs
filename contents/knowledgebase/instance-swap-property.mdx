## What is an instance?

Instance is a reusable copy of a main component. Instances are linked to their parent component, meaning changes made to the main component will automatically update all its instances.

A nested instance refers to a component placed within another component, for example a **Menu** component is nested inside a larger component, such as **Accordion**.

## MDS components using instance swap

In Moon Design System, the instance swap property is used by all container type components. This includes:

- Dialog
- Drawer
- Dropdown
- Card
- Accordion
- Bottom sheet
- Table cell

These components require this approach because their primary purpose is to provide consistent frame or interaction pattern for a variety of unpredictable content. For example, a Dialog's frame is always the same, but its content could be a form, a confirmation message or a detailed view of some item.

## Using an instance swap property

Follow these steps to place your own design into a slotted component.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Create your content as a component">
      Design the content you want to place inside the wrapper. This can be anything from a simple text block to a complex form. **You must turn this content into a component.**
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Place your slot component">
      Copy an instance of the slotted component from the Assets panel into your file. It will appear with default placeholder content.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Swap the content">
      With instance selected, locate the **Swap content** property in the right sidebar. Click the property's dropdown menu and select your custom component from the list.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Best practises

When creating your custom content component, try to follow these practices:
- **Add your own padding:** The wrapper component does not provide internal padding. You must add the necessary padding directly to your content component to ensure proper spacing
- **Use clear naming convention:** To keep the component library organized and easy to navigate, name your custom component using the following structure: `.MDS Accordion â†’ FAQ content`
- **Optionally, hide the component:** If your component is created only for a specific slot and will not be reused, you can hide it from the library by prefixing its name with a period `.`

Happy building!
