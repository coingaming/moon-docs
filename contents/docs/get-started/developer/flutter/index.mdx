## Install the package

To add Moon to your Flutter project, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
    flutter pub add moon_design
```

This will automatically update your `pubspec.yaml` with:

```yaml
  dependencies:
    moon_design: ^1.1.0
```

You can also add this line manually if preferred, and then run `flutter pub get`.

## Import the package

Once installed, import Moon into your Dart files:

```dart
  import 'package:moon_design/moon_design.dart';
```

## Start using Moon components

You can now use Moonâ€™s components just like any other widget. For example:

```dart
  MoonFilledButton(
    label: const Text("Get Started"),
    onTap: () {
      // Your action
    },
  )
```
